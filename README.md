# Recognition of Emotions in Audio Recordings
This repository contains the files of the research conducted as part of the Bachelor's Thesis. 

The essence of the study was to find out which features are most important for recognizing emotions in oral speech: intonation contour or pitch level. 

Based on the results of the study, dataframes were prepared containing the results of the prediction of the random forest model.

Experiments were performed on each of the CREMA, TESS, RAVDESS, SAVEE datasets, which resulted in trained random forest models.

Each of the folders **crema, ravdess, savee, tess** contains 6 files (3 dataframes and 3 models for each experiment)

The **Graphs.ipynb** file contains figures that demonstrate the quality of the models

The **experiments_notebook.ipynb** file contains the source code for model training and experiment setups

For a more detailed description of the methods and essence of the experiments, see the file **Andrushko_thesis_final.pdf**
